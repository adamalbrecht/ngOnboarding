# ngOnboarding

ngOnboarding is a tooltip tutorial / onboarding framework for [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/) that can help give your user a better onboarding experience. *The API is still in flux and it is not well-tested, so be aware before using it in production.*

## Dependencies

This library requires Angular.js 1.2 or greater along with any recent version of jQuery.

## Demo

You can find a very simple example of ngOnboarding [here](http://adamalbrecht.github.io/ngOnboarding/).

## The Basics
To use the library, add the JS and CSS file, then include the module in your app

```javascript
app = angular.module("myApp", ["ngOnboarding"])
```

Next, you'll need to configure the steps for the onboarding experience. The configuration is an array of objects, each representing a single popover. Here is an example configuration containing 2 popovers:

```javascript
$scope.onboardingSteps = [
  {
    title: "Welcome!",
    position: "centered",
    description: "Welcome to my app!",
    width: 300
  },
  {
    title: "Account Setup",
    position: "right",
    description: "This is the form for configuring your account.",
    attachTo: "#account_form",
    position: "bottom",
    nextFunction: function nextClick () { alert('Next btn clicked') },
    prevFunction: function prevClick () { alert('prev button clicked') }
  }
];
```

The directive itself is called *onboarding-popover*. There are 2 required inline attributes.

  * `enabled` should be set to a boolean scope variable that controls whether the onboarding UX is displayed.
  * `steps` should point to the steps configuration.

There are also 2 optional inline attributes.

  * `onFinishCallback` should point to a function that will be called when the user either clicks the Close or Done button. This is a good place to set a cookie to disable showing the on-boarding UX every time.
  * `stepIndex` is an integer that controls the current step being shown. It will default to 0 if not set explicitly.

```html
<onboarding-popover enabled="onboardingEnabled" steps="onboardingSteps" on-finish-callback='myCallbackFunction()' step-index='onboardingIndex'></onboarding-popover>
```

## Step Configuration Options

There are a number of options that can be passed to each step in your on-boarding process. These are set in the array of step objects, as shown above.

| Option              | Default   |                                           |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Title               | null      | Title of the popover                      |
| description         | null      | Content of the popover. May contain HTML. |
| attachTo            | null      | CSS selector for the element to attach to. Optional |
| position            | null      | Position of the tooltip relative to the attached element. Optional. Accepted values are 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom', or 'centered', All but centered require that `attachTo` is set. |
| width               | null      | Width of the popover. Defaults to the width of the content. |
| height              | null      | Height of the popover. Defaults to the height of the content. |
| top, right, bottom, left | null | Set the positioning of the popover explicitly.
| height              | null      | Height of the popover. Defaults to the height of the content. |
| xOffset             | null      | Offset the horizontal position of the popover relative to the attached element. |
| yOffset             | null      | Offset the vertical position of the popover relative to the attached element. |


## Overriding Directive Defaults

You can also pre-configure some options during your app's configuration phase.

```javascript
app.config(function(ngOnboardingDefaultsProvider) {
  ngOnboardingDefaultsProvider.set('option', 'value');
  // Or with a hash
  ngOnboardingDefaultsProvider.set({option: 'value', option2: 'value2'});
})
```

| Option              | Default   |                                             |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| overlay             | false     | Use a modal overlay for popovers by default |
| overlayOpacity      | 0.6       | Opacity of the modal overlay                |
| showbuttons         | true      | Show the next and previous buttons          |
| showDoneButton      | true      | Show a 'Done' button on the last popover    |
| showStepInfo        | true      | Shows 'Step X of Y' text on each popover    |
| closeButtonText     | X         | Text/HTML used for the close button         |

The CSS classes used in the HTML are also configurable. Please see the source for more info.

## Browser Support

So far, it has only been tested in Chrome. There is some CSS that is not compatible with with older browsers, including IE9.

## Future Updates

1. Test coverage
2. Ability to add an enter and leave callback to every step.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Whenever possible, please include test coverage with your contribution.

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

To get the project running, you'll need [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/). Run `npm install` and `bower install` to install all dependencies. Then run `grunt` in the project directory to watch and compile changes. And you can run `karma start` to watch for changes and auto-execute unit tests.

## Credit

Much of the CSS consists of tweaked versions of several [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) components. The API was partially inspired by a jQuery plugin called [Guiders.js](https://github.com/jeff-optimizely/Guiders-JS), though none of its code was used. And the styling was partially inspired by [Tourist.js](https://github.com/easelinc/tourist), though again, no code was used.
